## Introduction:

In this R Markdown document, we have documented our analysis (or attempted analysis) of two pharmacogenomic experiments and interpretation of their replicability. Our thought process was guided heavily by the provided materials, including this template and all the tutorials.

### Exploratory analysis of pharmacogenomic data

#### a. Basic attributes of the raw data

We began by exploring the raw Pharmaco Data file. In this dataset, there are 288 cell-lines and 15 drugs. The two studies, CCLE and GDSC, have 8 and 32 unique drug concentrations each respectively.This dataset has 6 different attributes; cell-line, drug type, dose ID, concentration, viability, and study.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

## import data
pharmacoData <- readRDS(file.path("data", "rawPharmacoData.rds"))


```

```{r}
head(pharmacoData)
str(pharmacoData)
```

#### b. Viability Distribution

We used a histogram to view viability distribution, and compare it with the data descriptions we obtained earlier. Based on the values visible in the first lines of the dataset, the distribution shown by the histogram seems to match that of known viability values. 

```{r}

# creating histograms for the separate studies
pharmacoData %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = viability)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "gray", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ study) +
  ggtitle("Distributions of viability by study") 

range(pharmacoData$viability)
sum(pharmacoData$viability)
sum(pharmacoData$viability < 0)
sum(pharmacoData$viability > 100)
```

However, although the distribution fits, some of the outlying points do not make sense considering the attribute type. The term "viability" refers to the percentage of cells that survive upon drug exposure, so in theory, all viability points should fall within the expected range of 0-100.

According to the above calculations, data points have a range of -20.0 to 319.4919. From a total of 3,826,909 points, only 23 points fall under 0, while 15778 points are above 100. Overall, the outlying points make up only 0.4% of data, and are not statistically significant. This is most likely due to a technical issue.

#### c. Comparing Variation Distributions


```{r}
pharmacoData %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = viability, group = study, fill = study, color = study)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 1/4) +
    xlim(0, 170) +
    ggtitle("Distributions of viability scores by study")
```

The graph shown above shows a comparison of viability distributions across the two studies. Overlaying the two distributions, there do not seem to be any major variations in viability. 

```{r}
pharmacoData %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = viability, group = doseID, fill = doseID, color = doseID)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 1/4) +
    xlim(0, 170) +
    ggtitle("Distributions of viability scores by dose ID")

```

This distribution shows viability distributions across dosages 1-9. These distributions are not as consistent, at higher dosages viability becomes less consistent with lower doses. The high dose curves have higher viability at lower levels, and lower viability at higher levels.

#### Summarized Data Exploration

We also explored the Summarized Data Exploration data. The summarized Data file contains 6 columns representing the variables cell Line, drug, and IC50 and AUC for the CCLE study as well as for the GDSC study.

```{r}
summarizedData <- readRDS(file.path("data", "summarizedPharmacoData.rds"))
str(summarizedData)
```

### Using Correlation Measures to Assess Replicability of Drug Response Studies

#### Comparison of AUC across cell lines

```{r}
summarizedData %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = -log10(auc_GDSC), y = -log10(auc_CCLE))) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1/2, cex = 1/2) + 
    facet_wrap(~ drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC AUC)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE AUC)") +
    ggtitle("AUC summaries of cell line response across studies")
```

Above we have representations of the various reactions cell Lines have with different drugs using AUC. To quantify these differences, we used Spearman correlations.

The calculating the correlation coefficients yielded fairly poor results, most of the values were below 0.5. The two drugs with the highest correlation coefficient were PD-0325901 (r = 0.607) and 17-AAG (r = 0.569). This suggests that across the two studies, there isn't particularly strong agreement.

```{r}
## with the tidyverse
drugCorrs <- summarizedData %>% 
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(Spearman_auc = cor(-log10(auc_GDSC / 10^6), -log10(auc_CCLE / 10^6), method = "spearman"))

drugCorrs
```

#### Comparison of IC50 across cell lines

```{r}
summarizedData %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = -log10(ic50_GDSC), y = -log10(ic50_CCLE))) +
    geom_point(alpha = 1/2, cex = 1/2) + 
    facet_wrap(~ drug) +
    xlab("-log10(GDSC IC50)") +
    ylab("-log10(CCLE IC50)") +
    ggtitle("IC50 summaries of cell line response across studies")
```

```{r}
## with the tidyverse
drugCorrs <- summarizedData %>% 
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(Pearson_ic50  = cor(-log10(ic50_GDSC / 10^6), -log10(ic50_CCLE / 10^6), method = "pearson"))
drugCorrs
```

We tried the same process with IC50, hoping to find greater agreement between the studies. However, IC50 correlations performed even worse than AUC's. Notably, some of the same drugs had the high correlation coefficients, PD-0325901 (r = 0.625) had the highest closely followed by 7 Nilotinib (r = 0.611). 17-AAG (r = 0.543), one of the highest in the AUC correlation calculations, had the third highest correlation coefficient in the IC50 calculations. The most consistent drug across both trials was 6 lapatinib, with a coefficient of r = 0.427 in the IC50 calculations vs r = 0.429 in the AUC calculations.

```{r}
## with the tidyverse
drugCorrs <- summarizedData %>% 
    group_by(drug) %>%
    summarize(Pearson_ic50  = cor(-log10(ic50_GDSC / 10^6), -log10(ic50_CCLE / 10^6), method = "pearson"),
              Spearman_auc = cor(-log10(auc_GDSC / 10^6), -log10(auc_CCLE / 10^6), method = "spearman"))

## with the tidyverse
drugCorrs <- gather(drugCorrs, measure, correlation, -drug)

drugCorrs %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = drug, y = correlation, fill = measure, group = measure)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(), colour = "black") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
    scale_fill_grey() +
    ylim(0, 1) + 
    ggtitle("Correlation of cell line IC50 summaries between studies for each drug")
```

### Identifying biological factors that influence replicability of pharmacogenomic studies

#### Analyzing Resistance and Sensitivity in Cell Lines
There seem to be some cell lines that seem to be consistently resistant, but the exclusion of these lines wouldn't increase replicability. The graph below shows the greatest correlation between studies of points close to (0,0) on the graph, which when looking at AUC values indicates higher resistance.

```{r}
AUC_study1 <- rbeta(200, 1, 5)
AUC_study2 <- rbeta(200, 1, 5)
resistant <- data.frame(AUC_study1, AUC_study2)

ggplot(resistant, aes(y = AUC_study2, x = AUC_study1)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlim(0, 1) +
    ylim(0, 1) +
    ggtitle("Simulated AUC of resistant cell lines")
```

The cell lines can be manipulated to show more resistant and more sensitive values. Looking at the graph below, our group determined an appropriate cutoff for resistance would be the vertical and horizontal assymptotes at (0, 25) and (25, 0).

```{r}
AUC_study1 <- c(rbeta(100, 1, 5), rbeta(100, 4, 2))
AUC_study2 <- c(rbeta(100, 1, 5), rbeta(100, 4, 2))
resistant <- data.frame(AUC_study1, AUC_study2, 
                        CellLine = c(rep("Resistant", 100), rep("Sensitive", 100)))

ggplot(resistant, aes(y = AUC_study2, x = AUC_study1, color = CellLine)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlim(0, 1) +
    ylim(0, 1) +
    ggtitle("Simulated AUC with half sensitive and half resistant cell lines")
```

#### Applying Resistance/Sensitivity principles to drugs

Using the principles we explored earlier, we can apply resistance and sensitivity principles to individual drugs, and determine the similarity of findings between the two studies.

```{r}
summarizedData <- summarizedData %>% 
              mutate(cutoff = ifelse(drug == "paclitaxel", 0.4, 0.1),
                     sensitivity_GDSC = factor(ifelse( auc_GDSC < cutoff, "Resistant", "Sensitive")), 
                     sensitivity_CCLE = factor(ifelse( auc_CCLE < cutoff, "Resistant", "Sensitive"))) 

table("GDSC" = summarizedData$sensitivity_GDSC,
      "CCLE" = summarizedData$sensitivity_CCLE)
```


```{r}
summarizedData <-
    summarizedData %>% 
    mutate(category = paste(sensitivity_GDSC, sensitivity_CCLE),
           category = fct_recode(category,
                                 "Both Resistant" = "Resistant Resistant",
                                 "Both Sensitive" = "Sensitive Sensitive",
                                 "GDSC Resistant / CCLE Sensitive" = "Resistant Sensitive",
                                 "GDSC Sensitive / CCLE Resistant" = "Sensitive Resistant"))

summarizedData %>%
    subset(drug == "PLX4720") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = auc_GDSC, y = auc_CCLE, colour = category)) +
    geom_point() + 
    xlab("GDSC AUC") +
    ylab("CCLE AUC") +
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = cutoff), colour="grey", alpha=0.75, lty=2) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = cutoff), colour="grey", alpha=0.75, lty=2) +
    ggtitle("Drug PLX4720")
```

The above graph represents agreement (pink and purple) and contradictory information (green and blue) about resistance and sensitivity to drugs between the two studies. 

```{r}
ggplot(summarizedData, aes(x = auc_GDSC, y = auc_CCLE, colour = category)) +
    geom_point(cex = 0.5) + 
    facet_wrap(~ drug) +
    xlab("GDSC AUC") +
    ylab("CCLE AUC") +
    geom_hline(aes(yintercept = cutoff), colour = "grey", alpha = 0.75, lty = 2) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = cutoff), colour = "grey", alpha = 0.75, lty = 2) +
    ggtitle("Cell line sensitivity classifications between studies")
```

Looking at the collection of scatterplots for individual drugs, there is obviously variation in the overlap of the two studies. Drugs like 17-AAG, Nilotinib, and PD-0325901 (which all, in the previous step, displayed had high correlation coefficient values) appear consist of a majority of pink/purple dots. To quantify the relationship between the studies, we can compute the Matthews correlation coefficient as shown below.

```{r}
## creation of a Matthews correlation coefficient
mcc <- function (study1, study2) {
    BS <- sum(study1 == "Sensitive" & study2 == "Sensitive") 
    BR <- sum(study1 == "Resistant" & study2 == "Resistant") 
    SR <- sum(study1 == "Sensitive" & study2 == "Resistant") 
    RS <- sum(study1 == "Resistant" & study2 == "Sensitive") 
    
    if (BS+SR == 0 | BS+RS == 0 | BR+SR == 0 |  BR+RS ==0){
        mcc <- ((BS*BR)-(SR*RS)) 
    }else{
        mcc <- ((BS*BR)-(SR*RS)) / sqrt(exp((log(BS+SR)+log(BS+RS)+log(BR+SR)+log(BR+RS))))
    }
    return(mcc)
}

drugCorrs <- summarizedData %>% 
    group_by(drug) %>% 
    summarise(matthews_corr = mcc(sensitivity_GDSC, sensitivity_CCLE))
drugCorrs
```

The Matthews Correlation Coefficients calculated indicate low levels of correlation between the two studies, none of the drugs have an r value greater than 0.5. Visually, drugs with higher MCC's appear to contain more pink/purple dots, indicating agreement. 5 Erlotinib (r = 0.432) and 6 lapatinib (r = 0.424) had the highest MCC's.

```{r}
ggplot(drugCorrs, aes(x = drug, y = matthews_corr)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
    xlab("Drug") +
    ylab("Matthews Correlation Coefficient")
```


### Modeling the relation between two variables (drug concentration vs viability)

1. Explore the response curves for several drug-cell line combinations. How many drugs-cell line combinations contain viability response values that would potentially enable them to be summarized into an IC50 value? You can answer this, for example, by checking whether there are viability values both above and below 50%.

2. Analyze the model-based re-calculations of IC50 and AUCs from the drug 17-AAG in the H4 cell-line and the drug Nilotinib cell-line in the 22RV1 cell-line. See the figure below and asnwer: which statistic is more roboust, IC50 or AUC? Which statistic is more generalizable, IC50 or AUC? Justify your answer with examples and/or using the whole data recalculations from the *modelSummarizedPharmacoData.rds* file.

```

3. Are the results more replicable if one uses the same code to calculate IC50 or AUC on the different datasets? Hint: you can use code from Tutorial 2a to evaluate this.

4. Summarize the viability curves of all the drugs in each cell-line using the slope of linear model. Is the slope of the linear regression informative of the drug response? Can we improve the replicability of the studies by using the value of the slope instead of IC50s or AUCs? 

## Overall Findings:

Summarize your conclusions regarding the level of concordance between the GDSC and CCLE studies. What are the most important considerations for fairly evaluating this question?

Additionally, please prepare a brief (10 minute) presentation of your conclusions and any other aspects of these data sets which you found particularly interesting or challenging.
